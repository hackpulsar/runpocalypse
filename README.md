# RUNPOCALYPSE
Times are tough. A new virus has left you with nothing but your pants and the ability to... run! So, do it! Show how long you can withstand the challenge of running from zombies who, in their desperate need to eat your brains, will spit at you, throw things, and... also run!

*This game is my submission for an OLC CodeJam 2024.
